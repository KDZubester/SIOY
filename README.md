# Instructions for Downloading and Setting Up Arduino Program and GitHub Files
Hello future engineers! These instructions will guide you on your first steps to canging the world with your skills and ideas by completing the DIY Digital Watch project. They will outline how to set up the coding environment you will use to control an Arduino and how to get your first program to run. There are three main sections to these instructions: (1) downloading the Arduino program; (2) downloading the GitHub files; (3) and compiling the Arduino code needed for the DIY Digital Watch project. This process should take no more than 10 minutes. So let's get started!
## Downloading the Arduino Program
### Step 1
Go to this webpage: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
### Step 2
Depending on what type of computer you are using, click on one of these three links.
