# Instructions for Downloading and Setting Up Arduino Program and GitHub Files
Hello future engineers! We are excited to share this fun engineering project with you! These instructions will guide you on your first steps to canging the world with your skills and ideas by completing the DIY Digital Watch project. They will outline how to set up the coding environment you will use to control an Arduino and how to get your first program to run. There are three main sections to these instructions: (1) downloading the Arduino program; (2) downloading the GitHub files; (3) and compiling the Arduino code needed to begin the DIY Digital Watch project. This process should take no more than 10 minutes. So let's get started!


## Downloading the Arduino Program

### Step 1
Go to this webpage: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

### Step 2
Depending on what type of computer you are using, click on one of these three links to start the download.

### Step 3
Click the file once the downlod is complete to launch the installer. Some of the steps for installation may differ slightly depending on what computer you are using.

### Step 5
Choose to install for a single user

### Step 6
Accept default file location

### Step 7
Complete installation and open the Arduino IDE

## Downloading the GitHub files

### Step 8
From the GitHub, click on green button that says "Code"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226771511-e568b523-3d27-42c8-b512-804fc9b7fee8.png)

### Step 9
Click "Download Zip" from the dropdown menu that appeared
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226771765-abfcf85e-16ef-4540-87b2-27067f0453cb.png)

This will download a .zip file that contains all of the folders you will need for this project

### Step 10
Click the carrot symbol on the icon that appeared on the bottom left of your window
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226771989-ae3a51ec-529b-442b-af1e-81303c110482.png)

### Step 11
Choose the "Show in Folder" option
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226772040-52b03f58-548c-4bb5-a41e-e768be659d3e.png)

### Step 12
Click on that option will take you to the location of where that .zip folder was downloaded to. You can change the location of where you want this folder to be so it is easier to find later.

### Step 13
Right click on the folder to make an options menu appear
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226772311-7fce53dc-5bc2-450c-b52a-d0e4db331b89.png)

### Step 14
Select "Extract All"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226772425-2f1e9532-07bd-4a5d-8438-c006897b0cc7.png)

This will allow you to fully access the data inside of the .zip folder

### Step 15
Select the location for the computer to send the unzipped folder to.
If you have not already picked an easy place to find the folder for later use, please do so now.

Once the computer is done extracting the data from the folder, it will take you inside the newly unzipped folder.

### Step 16
Double click on "Self-Starter-Kits-main" to enter the folder
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226772847-c318fcc4-3718-4497-85bd-0704b9bd929e.png)

There is a lot of stuff inside the folder. You can explore and use it however you want.

### Step 17
Double click on the folder titled, "Watch_02.1"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226773092-0b2b55e0-8ddb-4c9f-9dcc-61c9e03cfbec.png)

This folder has all of the code that the DIY Digital Watch will need to run.

### Step 18
Double click on the file named "Watch_02.1.ino"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226773203-bd785b97-69db-4794-aa57-bc6bd58d8a77.png)

This will open the Arduino project in the Arduino Program


## Compiling Arduino Code for the first time
KATHRYN YOU CAN PUT YOUR SCREENSHOTS HERE

### Step 19
Click the Verify button (blue checkmark) to compile program

NOTE: Most users will be missing the import libraries for the watch code, so compilation will most likely fail.  This is expected at this point.  

Compilation errors will be reported in the Output window
