# Instructions for Downloading and Setting Up Arduino Program and GitHub Files
Hello future engineers! These instructions will guide you on your first steps to canging the world with your skills and ideas by completing the DIY Digital Watch project. They will outline how to set up the coding environment you will use to control an Arduino and how to get your first program to run. There are three main sections to these instructions: (1) downloading the Arduino program; (2) downloading the GitHub files; (3) and compiling the Arduino code needed for the DIY Digital Watch project. This process should take no more than 10 minutes. So let's get started!
## Downloading the Arduino Program
### Step 1
Go to this webpage: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
### Step 2
Depending on what type of computer you are using, click on one of these three links.

THE HASHTAGS MAKE THE HEADINGS. LETS USE 3 HASHTAGS FOR THE STEPS HEADINGS
## Downloading the GitHub files
### Step [insert number]
From the GitHub, click on green button that says "Code"

### Step [insert number]
Click "Download Zip" from the dropdown menu that appeared

This will download a .zip file that contains all of the folders you will need for this project
### Step [insert number]
Click the carrot symbol on the icon that appeared on the bottom left of your window

### Step [insert number]
Choose the "Show in Folder" option

Click on that option will take you to the location of where that .zip folder was downloaded to. You can change the location of where you want this folder to be so it is easier to find later.

### Step [insert number]
Right click on the folder to make an options menu appear

### Step [insert number]
Select "Extract All"

This will allow you to fully access the data inside of the .zip folder
### Step [insert number]
Select the location for the computer to send the unzipped folder to.
If you have not already picked an easy place to find the folder for later use, please do so now.

Once the computer is done extracting the data from the folder, it will take you inside the newly unzipped folder.
### Step [insert number]
Double click on "Self-Starter-Kits-main" to enter the folder

There is a lot of stuff inside the folder. You can explore and use it however you want.
### Step [insert number]
Double click on the folder titled, "Watch_02.1"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63425135/226773092-0b2b55e0-8ddb-4c9f-9dcc-61c9e03cfbec.png)
This folder has all of the code that the DIY Digital Watch will need to run.
### Step [insert number]
Double click on the file named "Watch_02.1.ino"
